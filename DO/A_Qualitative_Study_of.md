Very nice paper, with material that is slightly trivialised by the passage of time. If one is in the situation of currently needing to transition their workspace to 'new best practices' from 2017, there's a ton to gather here. Otherwise, it's mostly reaffirmation of known information such as: automation is good, mixing developers and operations helps maintainability and agility, and changing the level and type of responsibility for employees leads to unsatisfaction.
