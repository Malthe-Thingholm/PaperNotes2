Frustrating paper. The authors have implemented a parallelisation framework for DRL, where it is parallel on multiple levels. Utilizing proper splits for both learners and GPU utilization for the learning itself (and even more on meta-learning it seems). So that part is quite cool, but it's a very superficial description the architecture is given, and no specifics for the actual implementation. 

It's also given a couple of interesting leads to other papers.
