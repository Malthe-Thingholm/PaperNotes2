Excellent paper. Super useful overview/relational-graphs in the first third, the later parts of the paper are pretty skippable if you're already aware of Microservice-based/Cloud Native approaches. Good references for future reading, though some are inherently outdated (this paper itself is 7 years old as of reading it, longer than the field was established as the time of its writing).
