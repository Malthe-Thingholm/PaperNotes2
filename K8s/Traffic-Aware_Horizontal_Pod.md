Cool paper with a simple premise and conclusion. Localizing scaling to be aware of incoming traffic flows such that it scales in higher intensity areas instead of needing to route the requests to other nodes improves performance. Their method seems sensible but improbable (other papers have more creative solutions, and also assumes availability for scaling at the 'edge' layer. 

Its tests/graphs are generally well made and useful as well as to-the-point, other than figure 5.
