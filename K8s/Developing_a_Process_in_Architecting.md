# Developing a Process in Architecting Microservice Infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio
Developing a Process in Architecting Microservice Infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, and Istio [arXiv:1911.02275](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02275)

Pretty much a 'why use Kubernetes (and Istio/a-service-mesh)' kind of paper. Provides proper reasoning and introduction, but not much practical use.

Has some code snippets to illustrate the experience of updating pods etc. But better versions exist in both books and just the documentation for fx. Istio.
