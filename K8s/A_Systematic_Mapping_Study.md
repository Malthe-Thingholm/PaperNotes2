# A Systematic Mapping Study in Microservice Architecture
A Systematic Mapping Study in Microservice Architecture[https://cris.brighton.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/428831/PID4474889.pdf](https://cris.brighton.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/428831/PID4474889.pdf)

Both a nice paper, and a bit of a useless paper. So the paper itself actually doesn't contain a lot of actionable information that isn't directly outdated (fx. the overview over different specification possibilities and current solutions. This partly follows that it was written shortly after even Kubernetes first came out (2016 vs 2014). 

What is of slight use is that it was written in a time where transitioning from monolithic to microservice was a focus point. As such some references might go deeper into this subject, as such this paper will be marked for further reading, mainly for reading such sources.
