Excellent paper, has both an academic focus as well as practical aspects. Refers a lot to papers detailing antipatterns in CI/CD in a way that seems like they find usefull stuff. Also contains table 3 which in the off chance that you'd need more work to do you could glance at and consider whether any topic on it could be an optimization you could perform on your pipeline.
