# Collaborative Computing Support for Analysis Facilities Exploiting Software as Infrastructure Techniques
Collaborative Computing Support for Analysis Facilities Exploiting Software as Infrastructure Techniques [arXiv:2006.15275](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15275)

Paper is about 'The analysis facilities at Nebraska and Fermi National Laboratory' beginning to utilize distributed computing on-premise for their scientific computing (i.e setting up Kubernetes on OKD on their computing clusters) and the problems they encountered during that endeavour. 

What can be of slight use is them noting that BinderHub (a tool to facilitate GitHubs as executable Jupyter Notebooks) had some permissions blocked on OKD in relation to the lifecycle of pods.
