Technical Report: Performance Comparison of Service Mesh Frameworks: the MTLS Test Case [arXiv:2411.02267](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02267)

Nice paper, illustrates performance comparisons between Istio, Istio Ambient, LinkerD and Cilium.

Istio is the worst performance-hog, with the others making various tradeoffs, mainly the sidecar methodology being pricey. 

The paper recommends further papers for performance comparisons.
