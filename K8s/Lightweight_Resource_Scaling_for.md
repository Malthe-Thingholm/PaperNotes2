Old but pretty on point paper, describes the use of monitoring latency and then scaling applications (in this case VM's because of the time the paper was written) up or down depending on said latency. Not much to learn other from it currently other than the improvements they make over non-scaling applications are very much still there when comparing to barebones K8s setups (heavier setups do have costs associated with them where that guarantee may not hold).
