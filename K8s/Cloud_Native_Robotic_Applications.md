# Cloud Native Robotic Applications with GPU Sharing on Kubernetes
Cloud Native Robotic Applications with GPU Sharing on Kubernetes [arXiv:2210.03936](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03936)

Not too useful a paper, is obviously intended as documentation for the University of Zurich. Tells of how they adjusted their K8s cluster and why they needed VMs for a robotics course. 

It does mention several points about using Cloud Native for robotics simulation, potential to use its sources for finding further reading material on the subject.
