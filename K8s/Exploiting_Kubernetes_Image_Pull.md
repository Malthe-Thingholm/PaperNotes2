# Exploiting Kubernetes’ Image Pull Implementation to Deny Node Availability
Exploiting Kubernetes’ Image Pull Implementation to Deny Node Availability [arXiv:2401.10582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10582)

Cool paper about a weakness in K8s due to communication layers in the stack. Summed up: a malicious user (with access to create and destroy for pods) can bypass quotas for allowed pod creation by force deleting created pods whilst they are deploying (specifically while they're downloading the image for creation) as this clears up in their quota whilst the actual deletion only happens after the pods have finished deploying, thus they can hog up most of the resources.

Also some well-made illustrations and graphs describing the relation of technologies in K8s.
