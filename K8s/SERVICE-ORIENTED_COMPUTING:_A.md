SERVICE-ORIENTED COMPUTING: A RESEARCH ROADMAP[https://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/ART-2008-15-SOC-Research-Roadmap-IJCIS.pdf](https://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/ART-2008-15-SOC-Research-Roadmap-IJCIS.pdf)

Old paper again. One noteworthy illustration returns in more detail this time (was also in the paper read just before this one). Cool seeing the outlining of grand goals all of which are to some degree accomplished by K8s. 

It stokes the ambition of wanting to understand the end-to-end of communication, i.e. the formats protocols etc. But ultimately the paper itself doesn't refer to many specifics, and the ones it do do refer to are also 'cutting-edge' of the time, so uncertain whether they're at all relevant or used to this day or ever.
