ENTS: An Edge-native Task Scheduling System for Collaborative Edge Computing[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07842](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07842)

Fantastic paper, does a great job at documenting their approach, on top of which i think it's a very sensible approach of modelling it with this approximate solution to an optimization problem. However, their result doesn't really scream "use this approach" as it's very obviously a tradeoff in performance. I'd be very interested in setting up other testing sandboxes for it and other approaches, as in comparison to some other papers this seems like non-handpicked-data. It also carries some overhead in further manual tagging of jobs.
