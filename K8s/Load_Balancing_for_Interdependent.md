# Load Balancing for Interdependent IoT Microservices
Load Balancing for Interdependent IoT Microservices [https://ruozhouy.github.io/docs/infocom-19-paper.pdf](https://ruozhouy.github.io/docs/infocom-19-paper.pdf)

Well-made paper, ultimately doesn't seem applicable directly, but probably has great proofs for further research.

Has the general approach of analysing load-balancing through the lens of the services as a DAG and making devolutions based on the pathings of that DAG. 

Their pseudocode and descriptions of restrictions for the optimization problems are very well made. However, they end up incurring a sizable overhead for not that much of an improvement over a method with a more simple quality of service preferred method. 

The graph representation seems like it could be good for this sort of problem setting, very involved proofs and algorithms for this paper though. I did like the approximation of optimality approach too.
