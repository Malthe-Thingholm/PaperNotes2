A Framework for dynamically meeting performance objectives on a service mesh [arXiv:2306.14178](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14178)

Pretty much a repeat paper of the 'Dynamically meeting performance objectives' paper, just much higher quality. The central points remain the same though.

It does seem more enticing to try out some ML variation on figuring out autoscaling, but more than that it entices to figure out some other more reliable and faster way to add effective autoscaling based on a variety of factors without the use of ML training sessions.
