FedApp: a Research Sandbox for Application Orchestration in Federated Clouds using OpenStack [arXiv:2109.01480](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01480)

Not much new (to me) theoretical insight from this paper. Mainly that they provide FedApp which is a sandbox prebuilt with OpenStack as an emulated multi-cluster/cloud setup through multiple VM clusterings that are then input into Kubernetes with an Istio service mesh. 

Also introduces (to me) the term 'cluster federation', meaning some loose association of clusters. Seems sensible when having more local/split setups where local pressure can none-the-less get strenuous and rerouting is needed.
