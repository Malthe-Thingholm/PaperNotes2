Service-Oriented Computing: Concepts, Characteristics and Directions[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262308599_Service_-Oriented_Computing_Concepts_Characteristics_and_Directions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262308599_Service_-Oriented_Computing_Concepts_Characteristics_and_Directions)

Old paper. Does provide a bit of insight into thought/patterns of the time, dated as they might be. Most of the strengths and problems discussed are still relevant, and the architectures and protocols they named might be interesting to look up. Not very technical, granted, the paper was written well before Kubernetes was conceptualized.
