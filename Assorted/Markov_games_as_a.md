# Markov games as a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning
Markov games as a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9781558603356500271](https://courses.cs.duke.edu/spring07/cps296.3/littman94markov.pdf)

Mainly material that I somewhat already know, as it's a fairly foundational paper. Does provide the additional perspective of using simulation/reinforcement algorithms as a stand-in for figuring out the value matrix yourself.
