FDSPC: Fast and Direct Smooth Path Planning via Continuous Curvature Integration [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03281v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03281v1)

Cool paper and algorithm. I believe there is some slight dishonesty in their choice of examples as a relatively simple figure exists that would massively counteract their approach. Yet it might be the standard examples in truth, so I shan't be too critical.

It's useful for finding a nice continuous path with nice curves that I'd describe as having momentum.
