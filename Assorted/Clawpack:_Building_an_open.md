Great paper. Would recommend for an introduction to what AMR is, what Clawpack is, what the extensions of Clawpack do, and how everything is built and operates and why to use it. The wave-propagation itself and Riemann problems are better understood by reading one of the 'CUDACLAW' or 'wave-propagation' papers.
