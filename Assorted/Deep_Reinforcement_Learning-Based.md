Didn't intend to read this paper, but it's fine. Makes a weird variety of assumptions on background knowledge, but I'm guessing it makes sense from a maritime biologist's POV.

Mostly about deep learning (specifically reinforcement learning with ADAM for gradient descent). Relatively uninteresting, with their main goal not really supporting their DL approach. The concept of prioritising between unreliable connections with various degrees of importance is an interesting scenario though (boats may have a stable or unstable connection to the antennae), where in their scenario throughput is restricted and they need to choose who gets what through (in their scenario messages, but could be services).
