Integration of CUDA Processing within the C++ library for parallelism and concurrency (HPX) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11482](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11482)

Great paper, refers the reader to a bunch of implementations for CUDA programming in their table 1. The one the rest of the paper explores is HPXCL/HPX-Computing-Language. Their result of testing is pretty much that implementing through it instead of barebones CUDA interface allows for easier optimisation with little overhead.
