[Productive FPGA Programming for High-Performance Computing](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/536674)

An extraordinary read. From a non-FPGA background, there were takeaways for optimisations in the first part wrt. unrolling and pipelining and generally approaching code without storing data, which gave great insight into optimization venues. Stuff that can be useful in the purview of supporting different parts of a FPGA-code delivery pipeline. 
The next two broader segments of first the DaCe and stenciling are useful as well, yet less approachable for deeper insight when not adept at the subject. Still considerations for graph-based optimisation with DaCe remain with me, whilst deeper insights will be left for other experiences with the framework. Stencils as a whole are in this category as well. Though I will remark that the overall themes themselves aren't too off-the-wall, but instead material I already am familiar with. So for one unfamiliar with these areas, they might feel similar insight in the same vein that i got from the first section, where the specifics that escapes the reader are what I'm caught up in right now.
